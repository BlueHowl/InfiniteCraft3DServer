[Personnal Project] 
This project is the backend of my copy of the web game InfiniteCraft (neal.fun). 
The idea is to later improve the game to make it 3D and use MeshyAI to generate 3D models of the generated words.

For now my server is used to store discovered nodes and combinations but the idea is to also use it as a proxy for MeshAI API calls.
